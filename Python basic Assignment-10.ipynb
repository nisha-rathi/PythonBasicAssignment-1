    "Q1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "Ans: shutil.copytree() will copy entire folder like branchers of trees (all files in it)\n",
    "    whereas shutil.copy() will copy only single folder\n",
    " \n",
    "Q2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "Ans: First import os module then use os.rename() to rename a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "Ans: send2trash sends file to recycle bin and shutil module deletes file permanantly.\n",

    "Q4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "Ans: to open or write to a zipfile we use 'w' as second argument similar to file objects open()\n",
